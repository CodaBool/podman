## How does it work?
When a `.container` file is placed into `/.config/containers/systemd` it automatically becomes a systemd service ðŸª„

## Structure
> I have a RAID 1 HDD with this structure
```
â””â”€â”€ mnt/
    â”œâ”€â”€ volumes/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ container_name
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .container_name.env
    â”œâ”€â”€ media/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ movies
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tv
    â””â”€â”€ sync
```

## Security
- [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks) provided by the tunnel container
- CloudFlare WAF blocking non-US traffic

## Automatic Updates
1. add `AutoUpdate=registry` to your `.Container`
2. `sudo systemctl enable --now podman-auto-update.timer`

## Automatic run on boot
`loginctl enable-linger 1000`

## Container Validation
`/usr/libexec/podman/quadlet --user --dryrun`

## Expose Podman socket
`systemctl enable --now podman.socket`


# Bootable Container
NixOS and CoreOS are leading the way for a stateless/immutable OS
The new tech buzz phrase for this is __Move Left__
Meaning more changes happen in the build step

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Since the OS can be checked into version control
> __The remote registry becomes the source of truth__

This is best targeted for on-prem. linux sys admins
Or in my case self-host hobbyist who like to throw time into Linux

> I missed the kubernetes for a single user plex server phase. So I have to get in on this one

### Details
> as defined by bootc project

- All directories except for `/etc` and `var` are mounted read only
  - state from these 2 paths are preserved across updates
- System can self-update when a new image is available
- Can roll back changes easily
- Can factory reset easily
- Defining disk partitions are still under the deployment step
- compatibility with existing Docker tools
  - this means Docker code scans, validation and signing are all portable to the OS itself in a familiar approach
